    <h4>Applications</h4>
    <p>Applications are computer programs created to perform specific functions. (Think word processors, web browsers, and image editing tools.) The following are all useful applications for developers— and they barely scrape the surface, giving you an idea of just how much is out there to make your job easier without cutting into your bottom line.</p>
    <h5>1. ATOM</h5>
    <p>Atom is a highly customizable text editor, but even out of the box it comes with enough features to keep you busy. Atom works across platforms, has smart autocomplete (useful for writing code), allows you to work in multiple sections of your screen, and supports a number of programming languages, including JavaScript, Ruby, and Ruby on Rails.</p>
    <h5>2. ITERM2</h5>
    <p>If you work on a Mac, you’ll sometimes need to use command line features, a direct way of interacting via text commands with your computer’s operating system. Normally this is done through the Mac’s terminal program, but the built-in Mac terminal can be a bit spartan. That’s where iTerm2 comes in handy. iTerm2 is a terminal emulator that functions like the Mac terminal, but with an impressive array of extra bells and whistles. There’s a split panes feature (each pane showing a different session with inactive sessions being dimmed), a robust search feature, an autocomplete that keeps track of any word that’s ever appeared in your window, and a paste history that lets you revisit recently copied and pasted text, to name a few features.</p>
    <h5>3. EVERNOTE</h5>
    <p>When you’re in the thick of working on a computer—with multiple browsers open and just as many trains of thought going—it’s easy for information and ideas to get lost. Evernote collects any notes you take—including screenshots and pictures of handwritten notes—and organizes them in one place synced across all your devices. It also has a powerful search feature that lets you search everything, even your handwritten words.</p>
    <h5>4. INVISION</h5>
    <p>In the design and development phase of a website, there will be times when you’ll want to share your work with your client. Being able to put together prototypes with the same software used by big name companies like Adobe, AT&T, Sony, and Viacom sounds like a good (but expensive) option, right? In reality, you can do that for free using InVision, the same prototyping tool used by those companies and many more.</p>
    <h5>5. Cyfe</h5>
    <p>Cyfe is a free-to-use online business dashboard that lets you keep track of a website’s uptime (the amount of time it’s been online without interruptions), social rankings, and analytics. Cyfe also lets you export that data in PNG, JPEG, PDF, and CSV formats for your own use or to share with</p>
    <h5>6. F.LUX</h5>
    <p>As a web developer you can work anywhere and anytime, which means you might want to get some work done in the evening hours. That kind of flexibility is a major perk of being a developer—but the glare of a computer monitor in your face in a nighttime room isn’t ideal. f.lux will adapt your computer display to the lighting in your room at all times, and this is a crucial resource if you’re going to be spending long hours in front of a monitor. Now, just remember to take frequent breaks to give your eyes a rest!</p>
