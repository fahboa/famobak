<h2>What is the Priority of a Web Developer?</h2>
<p>To answer the question <i>“What is a web developer?”,</i>
     we must first look at what a web developer does and how they do it.<br><br>
     A web developer or programmer is someone who takes a web design - which has been 
     created by either a client or a design team - and turns it into a website. They do this by
      writing lines and lines of complicated code, using a variety of languages. Web developers
       have quite a difficult job, because they essentially have to take a language we understand, 
       such as English, and translate it into a language that a computer understands, such as Python or HTML.<br<<br>
       As you can imagine, this can take a lot of time and effort and requires an intricate understanding of various 
       programming languages and how they are used. Different types of developers specialize in different areas, which 
       means that large web projects are usually a collaboration between several different developers.
    </p><br><br>
</div>
<div class="header" id="type1">
    <h2>What Types Of Web Developers Are There?</h2>
    <p>Unfortunately, the question <I>“What does a web developer do?” doesn’t have one simple</I>
        answer. As noted above, there are some different types of web developers, each of which
         focuses on a different aspect of the creation of a website.<br><br>
         To understand what is a web developer it is crucial to know that the three main types
          of developers are front-end, back-end, and full-stack. Front-end developers are responsible 
          for the parts of a website that people see and interact with, back-end developers are responsible
           for the behind the scenes code that controls how a website loads and runs, and full-stack developers
            do a bit of everything.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="front">
        <h2>Front-End Developer</h2>
        <p>A front-end developer is someone who takes a client or design team’s website design and writes 
            the code needed to implement it on the web. A decent front-end web developer will be fluent
             in at least three programming languages - HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.<br><br>
             HTML allows them to add content to a website while splitting it into headings, paragraphs,
              and tables. CSS lets a decent developer style the content and change things like colors,
               sizes, and borders. JavaScript allows the inclusion of interactive elements, such as push
                buttons. We will go into more detail about these languages later.<br><br>
                <i>So, what do web developers do when they work on the front end of a website?</i>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>What is a web developer responsible for is that they make sure that all
                     of the content that is needed for the website is clear, visible, and
                      found in the right place. In some cases front-end developers may also have 
                      content writing skills, allowing them to create the content for the website as they go.</li>
                      <li>They make sure that the right colors are in the right places, especially concerning
                           text colors, background colors, and headers. Some of the best front-end developers are 
                           also very good designers, allowing them to tweak things as they go.
                    </li>
                      <li>They make sure that all outbound links are correctly formatted, that all buttons work properly,
                           and that the website is responsive and attractive. Mobile design is usually a big part of the job,
                            while it is also important to make sure that a website will display correctly on all web browsers.
                    </li>
            </ol>
            <p>As you can see, the answer to the question <i>“What is a web developer?”</i> certainly isn’t simple. Even front-end developers
                 have it tough, and this is probably the simplest of the three types of development to learn.<br><br>
                 If you want to become a front-end developer, though, head to our article, which can tell you the secrets of becoming an entry 
                 level front-end developer.
                </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="back">
        <h2>Back-End Developer</h2>
        <p>While it may seem like front-end developers have a difficult job 
            making sure that a website looks great, works well, and contains the 
            correct content, <a>back-end developers</a> have it much worse. While front-end 
            developers are responsible for client-side programming, 
            back-end developers have to deal with the server-side.<br><br>
            This means that they have to create the code and programs which 
            power the website’s server, databases, and any applications that it
             contains. The most important thing as a back-end developer is the ability 
             to be able to create a clean, efficient code that does what you want it to in 
             the quickest way possible. Since website speed is a major consideration when it comes 
             to search engine optimization (SEO), it is a large factor when developing the back-end.<br><br>
             To fully explain what is a web developer it is essential to know that back-end developers use 
             a wide range of different server-side languages to build complicated programs. Some of the most 
             popular languages used include PHP, Python, Java, and Ruby. JavaScript is also becoming 
             increasingly widespread as a back-end development language, while SQL is commonly used 
             to manage and analyze data in website databases.<br><br>
             Since different websites have different needs, a back-end developer must be flexible, 
             able to create different programs, and they absolutely must have a clear, in-depth understanding
              of the languages that they use. This is very important to make sure that they can come up with 
              the most efficient method of creating the required program while making sure that it is secure, 
              scalable, and easy to maintain.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="full">
        <h2>Full-Stack Developer</h2>
        <p>If you are looking for a quick, simple answer to the question “What is a web developer?”,
             then a full-stack developer is probably the closest thing that you’re going to get. 
             <a>Full-stack developers</a> understand both front and back-end strategies and processes, 
             which means that they are perfectly positioned to oversee the entire process.<br><br>
             In the case of small websites that don’t have a huge development budget, a full-stack developer 
             will often be employed to build the entire website. In this case, it is extremely important 
             for them to have a complete, in-depth understanding of both front and back-end development and how they work.<br><br>
             In the case of small websites that don’t have a huge development budget, a full-stack 
             developer will often be employed to build the entire website. In this case, it is extremely 
             important for them to have a complete, in-depth understanding of both front and back-end development
              and how they work.<br><br>
              Learning full-stack development techniques has a huge range of benefits, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You will end up with the knowledge to be able to create an entire website on your own. This makes you a lot more employable, increasing your job security in the future.</li>
            <li>As a full-stack developer, you will understand the connections between the front and back-ends of a website, allowing you do build efficient and effective programs for all parts of the website.</li>
            <li>Full-stack developers are often employed to oversee large projects for big web development companies. Positions like this are likely to be paid more than standard web development positions, making them more attractive to developers. Full-stack defines what is a web developer.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Although most developers start with either front or back-end specializations,
             there are a lot of reasons why you should consider branching out and learning
              both. It will make you a lot more employable, will give you a greater understanding 
              of the whole concept of what is web development, and will make it easier for you to
               create entire websites on your own.</p>

    <div class="header" id="web">
        <h2>Web Design vs Web Development</h2>
<p>Now, we need to digress for a moment to address an important point that often comes up when people 
    start talking about web development - the web design vs web development debate. Are they different? 
    Are they the same thing?<br><br>
    The answer is no, web design and web development are not the same, but of course, it depends on how 
    you define ‘design’ and ‘development’. For our article, we have assumed that it takes different knowledge 
    to understand what is a web designer and what is a web developer. These professions are different and they 
    have the following roles:<br><br>
    <i>Web Developer:</i><br><br>
    The web designer is the person or group of people who are responsible for the creation of the website concept. 
    They might decide that it needs to be a certain color, with certain content and pages. They may do things like creating
     infographics, logos, and videos, and they tell the developer where these things have to be put on the web page. However, 
     they don’t take part in the construction of the website or the underlying code.<br><br>
     <i>Web Developer:</i><br><br>
     If you want to be a designer, you won’t necessarily have to learn any code at all. Likewise, 
     a developer doesn’t need to have any graphic design skills at all. From this, it follows that ‘designing a 
     website’ is not part of the answer to ‘What is a web developer?’.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="languages">
        <h2>Popular Languages For Web Development</h2>
        <p>Now, it is very important to realize that there is a range of different languages that
             are used for web development. As noted above, front and back-end developers will 
             need to learn different languages, while full-stack developers will need 
             a working knowledge of all the major web development languages.<br><br>
             With this in mind, we have put together a list of some of the most common languages 
             for web developers to learn, along with an explanation of what they are used for
              and how you can learn them.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="htmls">
        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <p>HTML is an essential language if you want to understand what is a web developer 
            and how to become a front-end one. To explain it fully, I need you to do something for me:<br><br>
            <i>Right-click on your browser window, and select ‘view page source’.</i><br><br>
            You should be taken to a new tab containing all of the information which goes into the creation 
            of this webpage. What you are seeing is mainly HTML code. It tells the website what content to 
            display and to some extent, how to display it. At the top of the page, on the first line, you will 
            see the <!DOCTYPE html> command. This tells your web browser to expect HTML code.<br><br>
            If you explore further, you will start to recognize things on the page. You will see some commands that you understand, such as ‘link’, ‘image’, or ‘video’. These are all content commands which tell your browser what to show, where to get the content from, and how to show it.
 </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="css3">
        <h2>css</h2>
        <p>CSS is the second of the essential front-end languages and is also one which every front-end developer must be fluent in. The CSS code is used in conjunction with HTML. While HTML tells the webpage what content to display, CSS tells the webpage how to display the content - it’s a ‘styling’ language.<br><br>
            Once you have learned CSS, you will be able to do a wide range of things, including:
        </p>
<ul>
    <li>Changing colors. CSS allows you to change the color of pretty much everything from your paragraph text to your background to your table borders.</li>
    <li>Changing fonts. CSS also lets you choose the fonts that you are going to use on your website and where you are going to use them.</li>
    <li>Positioning elements. One of the key elements of what is a web developer capable to do is arranging everything you see in the website. HTML lets you add images and videos to your webpage, but CSS lets you tell the browser how big to make them and where to display them.</li>
    <li>Changing text size. Are you building a website designed for people with poor eyesight? If so, you will need to use your knowledge of CSS coding to make your text larger.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, CSS plays a big role in web development, especially to front-end developers.
</p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="Java">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <p>What do web developers do? Well, most web developers take a programming language like Java or HTML and use it to create a component of a website. JavaScript developers are no different, except they create very specific content. So, for JavaScript, what is a web developer exactly?<br><br>
            Most JavaScript developers work on the front-end of a website. They build small snippets of JavaScript code that make your website responsive, interactive, and attractive to your visitors. These JavaScript snippets are often embedded in the HTML source code for a website.<br><br>
            Although it has traditionally been a front-end language, and one which is vital for any front-end developer to learn, JavaScript is becoming increasingly popular for back-end development as well. A lot of front-end developers are beginning to find work as full-stack developers due to their knowledge of JavaScript, which means that its usage and popularity is skyrocketing.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="phps">
        <h2>PHP</h2>
        <p>Historically, PHP has dominated definitions of what is a web developer. Known as the language of the internet, it is currently used in some form on over 80% of websites in existence. Although it is slowly decreasing in popularity, PHP is still a great language for any back-end web developer to learn.<br><br>
            PHP is very easy to learn and is quite easy to use, which makes it very popular for beginner back-end developers. It is very popular on small websites built on platforms like WordPress or Wix, and there are plenty of freelance work opportunities for PHP developers.<br><br>
            If this sparks your interest, consider taking an online PHP course. Note that it is very important to take an up to date course, like those offered by BitDegree, as older versions of the language are quite different from the modern version (PHP7).
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="header" id="javas">
        <h2>Java</h2>
        <p>The last of the languages on our list, Java, has been a major part of what is a web developer for years. It is an old language and is popular for a variety of different programming uses. From a web development sense, Java is used to create responsive, scalable web apps that are used for responsive, fast website design.<br><br>
            Java is an essential language for many back-end developers. It is quite easy to learn, which makes it beginner-friendly, and it is very easy to use. It is super scalable, which makes it popular among larger websites like eBay and Amazon, and it is very easy to maintain.

<h2>On Your Path to a Web Developer</h2>
<p>If you would like to become a web developer, 
    you must first choose between front-end, back-end,
     and full-stack development. You will need to learn the
      relevant languages, and you will need to practice building 
      websites and the applications which run them.</p>
