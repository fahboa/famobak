<h5>How To Prevent Burnout As A Developer</h5>
<p class="pee">A good developer is a happy developer</p>
<img src="img/prevention.jpeg"><br>
<p class="pee">Because life is more than just coding</p><br>
</div>
<p>In the world of developers, there is always a possibility that one day we start to feel tired, uninspired, we start to lose our passion, we’ll start to lose that burning desire, and we question ourselves more often, especially when things aren’t working as we expect them to be, not working according to your plan, this usually happens after that excitement starts to fade out, that honeymoon phase where it feels like we can do anything, we can build anything, and when the hard part starts to kick in, we then start to feel all the pressure, that urge of seeing results and get frustrated for not seeing any.
<br><br>But you have to know that everyone else feels the same, every successful developer today felt the same, what you feel now is normal, I’ve been there too, and here we will tackle about how we can avoid and overcome this challenging phase we all have.
<br><br>But you have to know that everyone else feels the same, every successful developer today felt the same, what you feel now is normal, I’ve been there too, and here we will tackle about how we can avoid and overcome this challenging phase we all have.
<br><br>This trap is something really serious and we need to fix it, this is where a lot of developers start to give up or eventually give up, and we will avoid that as much as possible, with just little changes in your routine, will help you back on your feet again.
</p>
<h6>Why do we experience burnout</h6>
<p>Burn out has been very common to every programmer because of the critical stress it demands, being a programmer means solving problems that could easily lead to frustrations, anger, and disappointments, and you can’t function every day without getting yourself out of that situation once in a while, our job as a developer is highly cognitively intensive and stressful.<br><br>
	Other factors could be the pressure for deadlines, the pressure from the senior developer’s demands and standards, the request from other nontechnical teams, revisions from clients, and any other concerns from colleagues such as sudden changes with your technology stacks could drive you insane.
<br><br>Another thing that could add up into this deep hole is that responsibility or thought that we need to learn new technologies every day to catch up with the demands in the field, to stay competitive, and to not fall behind the other developers, and it is not easy to deal with, there’s that guilt we feel or at least some that whenever we feel like we are not working hard or choosing to take a day off without touching that computer or laptop, that guilt feeling is real.
<br><br>And this disease will not bring any good, and we need to settle this once and for all. Don’t feel guilty when you choose to sleep or when you choose to spend the day with your loved ones, with your partners, parents or even spending the day without doing anything, you deserve a break, you deserve to enjoy the fruits of your labor, to function effectively we need to take good care of our bodies and our mind, our well-being and health should be our priority, it is the foundation of our life, we really can’t do anything if we are not well, so take that day off.<br><br>
One good example is that whenever you are trying to resolve some bugs or any technical issues on the development for an hour or two, it is probably best for you to go outside, take some fresh air, do other activities, you can even do your laundry and take your mind out of it, you can’t just think outside the box, sometimes we need to think like there is no box at all.<br><br>
The little things we can do that will help build-up our habits and routine are the ones that will save us from this deep hole.
</p>
<h6>Life behind your computers and laptops</h6>
<p>Your job is not just about doing what your boss tells you to do, or getting the job done. It is also your responsibility to be happy, to have fun, and to make yourself fall in love with programming, with your craft and skills every day, feed your soul, it is the only way to stay consistent, to thrive, and to keep that fire burning.<br><br>
	Other than working on your computers, it is also a good practice to socialize or to make connections with other developers and non-tech colleagues.
<br><br>Explore other things that you are curious about, play around with other technologies that interest you, just because your job only involves Javascript and Reactjs doesn’t mean you can’t explore Nodejs or Mongodb, if there are other technologies that you’ve always been curious about, then make time for it and play around, you really wouldn’t know what you want if you don’t open yourself to other possibilities that there are other things that are much better than you thought you know.<br><br>
Experiment, play and learn whatever it is that makes you feel alive and makes you fall in love more in this field, who knows that personal application that you built out of curiosity might end up become tech billionaire, you never really know where your curiosity could lead you, sometimes you just have to keep digging until you find your diamond.
<br><br>Being a developer especially when you are working from home could be lonely at times because it isolates you from the world, so you must spend some time seeing other human beings, you can choose to attend seminars, boot camps, meetups to find like-minded people like you, it will not just help you make new friends, you will also learn a lot by their experiences, by their perspectives, even topics outside programming, it will help you be more motivated and practice your social skills which are important as a developer.
<br><br>Meeting up other developers will also benefit you as you build your network for your future references and plans, so when you decided to go freelancing for good having so many developer friends could become a luxury.
<br><br>Don’t focus only on the skills, being a developer could be a lot of things, at the end of the day the most important thing is your well-being, you really can’t do anything if you don’t take good care of yourself, of your happiness, and you can’t build the next big thing if you don’t start with yourself, be the best version of yourself, and everything else will follow.</p>
